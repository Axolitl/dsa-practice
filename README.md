# DSA Practice  

This repository contains my implementations of **Data Structures and Algorithms** as part of my learning.  

## Structure  
- `sorting/` – Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)  
- `searching/` – Search algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)  
- `data_structures/` – Custom implementations (Linked List, Stack, Queue, etc.)  

Each algorithm includes explanations, code, and basic test cases.  

## Goal  
To document my progress while learning and practicing DSA, and to share my approach with others.
